Organizational Overview

Founded in 2003 to provide a free, public, high-quality college preparatory education for the students of East Boston and Chelsea, Excel is proving that children’s ability to succeed in high school, college, and beyond is not determined by zip code. We have grown from one school serving approximately 200 students to a network of four schools serving more than 1,300 students, and our purpose and theory of change remains consistent: we believe that when a student has the support and tools to pursue a productive post-secondary pathway aligned with personal identity and values, it can fundamentally change his/her life trajectory. As a true public school, Excel is defined not by whom we exclude but by whom we include in our community. We are proud of the fact that we serve many students with special needs.

After 8 years of operating a small single-site middle school in East Boston, Excel was designated a “Proven Provider” by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and granted two additional charters to serve middle school students. After four more successful years, Excel Academy Charter High School opened in 2015. In spring 2019, we are excited to cheer on our first senior class as they become the first cohort to receive high school diplomas from Excel.

SMALL PLANET INSTITUTE DEMOCRACY INTERNSHIP


The Small Planet Institute is currently seeking energetic and motivated interns to join our dynamic team. This is a unique opportunity to work directly with Frances Moore Lappé, author of 19 books, including best-selling Diet for a Small Planet, in a small organization doing groundbreaking work to inspire and empower passionate action for democracy system and environmental policy reforms in the United States.

ORGANIZATION DESCRIPTION
Frances Moore Lappé and Anna Lappé founded the Small Planet Institute in 2001. Small Planet Institute spreads an empowering understanding of democracy as the wide dispersion of power, transparency in public affairs, and a culture of mutual accountability. We call it Living Democracy, enabling each of us to act effectively on emerging solutions from electoral politics and economic life to the environment, hunger, agriculture, and beyond.

Our goal is thus a future where all communities are thriving with dignity as Living Democracies, fulfilling our essential needs for personal power, meaning, and connection.  

INTERN OPPORTUNITY OVERVIEW
Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 will be a thrilling time at Small Planet. Frances is beginning to work on a sequel to her 2017 book Daring Democracy. The new book will be about the connections between the climate change movement and its roots in economic and political democracy. Also we are excited to continue our democracy movement work through social media, research and writing.  A current project is curating and promoting a new website DemocracyMovement.US which is scheduled to go live in August that we are developing in partnership with the Democracy Initiative.

TIME COMMITMENT
Scheduling is flexible—we're willing to work around school schedules, vacations, and other commitments. We ask for a minimum commitment of 12-15 set hours per week in our Harvard Square office. Applications are being accepted for Fall 2019 and Spring 2020 semesters and are considered on a rolling basis year-round. We happily welcome applications for the entire 2019-2020 school year. Please note on your application if you are applying for a single semester or for the whole school year. (We are full for Summer 2019.)

QUALIFICATIONS
A passion for social democratic movements and the mission of the Small Planet Institute is required. The ideal candidates have excellent verbal and written communication skills. Superb research and social media content creation are a plus, including familiarity with Hootsuite, WordPress, and Canva. They are equally comfortable with teamwork and individual work. They excel even with minimal direction and supervision and are able to follow directions when given. Our interns contribute substantially to the programming of Small Planet. All majors are encouraged to apply.

DESCRIPTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES
The percentage of time you might spend on each work area below will vary depending on whether or not Frances has a book deadline.  The focus will be mainly on social media and research for Frances’ new book.  Work area opportunities may include:
•	Creating and posting social media and web content;
•	Research of democracy organizations and campaigns to curate the DemocracyMovement.US website;
•	Research assistance for articles, blogs, fact sheets, and other publications;
•	Copy-editing print and web pieces for publication;
•	Supporting academic and partner outreach campaigns;
•	General office support.


BENEFITS
•	Academic credit available;
•	Receiving a letter of recommendation from a highly recognized name in the democracy and food movement world;

Wizards & Warriors Camp is a creative STEM-based summer camp run by professionals, parents, and teachers who wanted to create the experience of a live adventure as a way to help kids and teens discover the hero they hold inside.

Are you / Do you:

Love working with kids?
Have a fascination with the fantasy genre?
Have a very active imagination?
A responsible and good role model?
Don’t mind being hit with foam weapons?
Like to dress in costume and wear cool makeup?
Consider safety BEFORE anything else – no matter how fun?
If you responded “yes” to each of the above, then you should consider applying to staff at our camp!

Our camp counselors receive one of the highest pay rates in the industry. We provide training, costumes (although you can bring your own!), props, makeup, and foam weapons.

In return, our expectations are high. We require you to be responsible, flexible, and reliable. You must fully embrace and adhere to the concept that this camp is for the campers, which means that all of our staff are having the most amount of fun when our campers are having tons of fun. As such, the roles you play and the positions you hold are always in service of the entertainment value. We all have favorite characters we enjoy playing, but what is more important is if the campers like the characters (or at least like fighting them).

We only invite back staff who meet our high level of performance. It is an exhausting, demanding job that requires both physical and mental endurance. But you will have the time of your life and we can guarantee that you will never be bored!

All camp staff are required to have previous experience working with kids and teens and be at least 18 years of age. Acting experience is not necessary but does help. We’re interested in mature decision makers – counselors and performers who like to take part in a creative, improvisational environment – but always with safety foremost in their mind. You must be exceptionally reliable and a good communicator. Punctuality is necessary as the nature of these activities requires precision timing. Professionalism is mandatory.

Please note that Wizards & Warriors Camp is owned and run by parents. Our own children attend these camps. Safety is our highest concern. We expect that it will be yours as well.

References required.  Must be available: Sunday, June 23 – Wednesday, August 14 for overnight/day camp in Salem 

Salem Summer Camp Overnight Counselor positions pay is depending on experience and schedule for 7 weeks plus room and board (includes paid training).  This is an overnight position with onsite residency required.

Salem Summer Camp Quest-Day Counselor positions pay is depending on experience and schedule for 7 weeks plus lunch (includes paid training).  Residency not required.  Transportation provided from bus stops.

Summer Quest Camp hours are 8am-4pm (or as early as 7am and as late as 6pm) for up to 7 weeks and counselors do not reside at the camp.

Residential/Overnight Summer Camp is up to 7.5 weeks with one or two days off each week and counselors are required to reside at the camp (except for their day off).

All staff, performers, and volunteers must submit to a CORI and SORI Background Check, intensive screening, and reference check.

The best candidates are…

Age 20 and over with experience working with kids of various ages.  Teachers and childcare professionals are strongly encouraged to apply.
People who love teaching in a positive learning environment and who have afternoons or weekends available.
Residential/Overnight and Day Camp Counselors who have background in theater or acting.
Coaches, Teachers, Instructors, or Group Leaders who are passionate about working with kids, but may not have experience in our particular activities.
No experience in swordsmanship is necessary. We will train you!

Camp Counselor roles include:

Weapons Master
Guildmaster Librarian
Monster Chief
Ranger
Healer Guildmaster

IHI collaborates with a growing community to spark bold, inventive ways to improve the health of individuals and populations. IHI generates optimism, harvests fresh ideas, and supports anyone, anywhere who wants to profoundly change health and health care for the better. Learn more at ihi.org.

COMPANY PROFILE
At Springwell, we are serious about our mission. For more than 40 years, our staff has worked to help ensure that seniors and individuals with disabilities have the village they need and the support that is necessary for them to live at home with dignity and independence.
We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, and welcoming environment that values each and every member of our staff. At Springwell we are fiercely committed to creating equal opportunities for all regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender expression, national origin, age, language, and physical or mental disabilities. 
We believe in:
Accountability: At every level of the organization we are accountable: to the people we serve, to our funders, to our employees, to community professionals who rely on our support.
Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.
Transparency: While we don't claim to be 100% transparent (there are certain things, like salaries and performance evaluations that are private) we continuously strive to be as open as possible.
Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms. We are committed to listening to our staff, and examining and re-balancing our work environment.

At Springwell, we are serious about our mission. For more than 40 years, our staff has worked to help ensure that seniors and individuals with disabilities have the village they need and the support that is necessary for them to live at home with dignity and independence.
We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, and welcoming environment that values each and every member of our staff. At Springwell we are fiercely committed to creating equal opportunities for all regardless of race, color, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender expression, national origin, age, language, and physical or mental disabilities. 
We believe in:
Accountability: At every level of the organization we are accountable: to the people we serve, to our funders, to our employees, to community professionals who rely on our support.
Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.
Transparency: While we don't claim to be 100% transparent (there are certain things, like salaries and performance evaluations that are private) we continuously strive to be as open as possible.
Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms. We are committed to listening to our staff, and examining and re-balancing our work environment.

We are also serious about our employees. We are focused on creating a supportive, and welcoming environment that values each and every member of our staff.

Continuous Quality Improvement: We honor the fact that each of us is human, and we embrace a desire to examine the value and quality of our work and ask how we can provide a higher quality of service.

Balance: Life is a give and take, as is work. We are always examining that balance. Today, we have yoga classes on-site twice a week. We are exploring offering a Weight Watchers meeting. And afternoon meditation is under consideration. If there is a holiday to celebrate we have a party. This year, we built a dedicated lactation room for new moms. We are committed to listening to our staff, and examining and re-balancing our work environment.

About Health Resources in Action
Health Resources in Action (HRiA) is a nonprofit organization based in Boston, MA dedicated to promoting public health and advancing medical research.
